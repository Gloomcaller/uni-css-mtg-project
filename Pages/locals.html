            <h2 class="featured">Metagame & Matchups</h2>
            <p>Understanding the local metagame and knowing how to handle various matchups is crucial for success. Here
                are a few tips and strategies against some of the popular decks you might face in your local scene.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adapt your sideboard depending on the most popular decks at your locals.</li>
                <li>Make sure your deck is well-rounded with enough removal and card advantage tools to suit various
                    decks at yout local turnament store or club.</li>
                <li>Some cards like <a href="./lands.html">Bojuka Bog</a> and <a href="./sideboard.html">Relic of
                        Progenitus</a> are useless if there isn't a single Storm or other graveyard heavy deck at your
                    locals.</li>
                <li>It's always wise to get to know your local patrons so you can know what they play and their habits
                    and strategies, and don't just be a spy make some acquaintances while you are having fun !</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <p class="featured">These are just some of my suggestions on how I think you should sideboard versus some decks
            in the metagame.</p>
        <section class="info-box">
            <h2 class="featured">Kuldotha Rebirth</h2>
            <p>The Kuldotha Rebirth has evolved over time gaining considerable power with a combination of strong
                goblins and artifacts like Experimental Synthesizer so it's no mystery why it's seeing a 16.6% play in
                turnaments.</p>
            <p>While we do have a decent life gain with <a href="./creatures.html">Vampire Sovereign</a> and <a
                    href="./spells.html">Spinning Darkness</a> <a href="./sideboard.html">Fangren Marauder</a> may seem
                expensive, but if you can get
                it down, it will most likely win you the game.
                Gaining effectively two burn spells worth of life by sacrificing your treasure token or wellspring is
                incredibly powerful. Not to mention every time they want to sacrifice their Synthesizer or implement it
                comes at the cost of giving you 5 life.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="info-box">
            <h2 class="featured">Affinity</h2>
            <p>Basic game plan against Affinity is to try to answer all their important creatures and time it right
                with <a href="./lands.html">Bojuka Bogs</a> and <a href="./sideboard.html">Relic of
                    Progenitus</a>, so they don't get the opportunity to recur with Blood Fountain.
            </p>
            <p>Maximizing on <a href="./creatures.html">Avenging Hunters</a> is key, because the <a
                    href="./creatures.html">Undercity</a> is great at stealing games from under their feet. Hopefully
                you can get Avenging Hunter down before they flood the board with free 4/4 creatures. Marauder and
                Deglamer are great cards here just for disrupting their game plan wherever possible.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="info-box">
            <h2 class="featured">Caw Gates</h2>
            <p>This match up should be fairly favoured. They have surprisingly few threats and very little permission,
                so answering every threat can be relatively easy. However, throwing away Chainer's Edict can be a sure
                way to lose this match up. You can just lose to a surprise Guardian of the Guildpact.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="info-box">
            <h2 class="featured">Terror</h2>
            <p>Fairly straight forward sideboarding here. <a href="./sideboard.html">Relic of
                    Progenitus</a> is great at slowing down the Terror Gameplan. <a href="./spells.html">Duress</a> is
                great at making sure you get to take the troublesome spells like Counterspell and Chainer's Edict.</p>
            <p>All those are basically free as <a href="./spells.html">Spinning Darkness</a> and Fungal Infection
                doesn't answer anything so you can side them out.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="info-box">
            <h2 class="featured">Faeries</h2>
            <p><a href="./sideboard.html">Drown in Sorrow</a> is obviously a great card for dealing with the faeries in
                the air, which should in turn allow the Chainer's Edict and other removal spells to deal with the
                Ninjas.</p>
            <p><a href="./creatures.html">Avenging Hunter</a> is a great card here for finishing the game and killing
                your opponent even through Snaps. However, with all their combat tricks and flash creatures, you really
                need to make sure you can answer everything they could before playing it.</p>
